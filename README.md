# Dynamic-Storage-Auditing-In-Blockchain
Developed a distributed editor to reduce redundancy and optimize space consumption for dynamic documents managed by multiple users. All minor changes are stored locally controlled by a relay and only the major updates are committed to IPFS and blockchain. Implemented successfully, and tested in a local environment.
